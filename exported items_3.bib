	abstract = {An early warning system on potential attacks from networks will enable network administrators or even automated network management software to take preventive measures. This is needed as we move towards maximizing the utilization of the network with new paradigms such as Web Services and Software As A Service. This paper introduces a novel approach through using Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) technique to detect potential attacks that may occur in the network. The solution is able to provide feedback through its predictive capabilities and hence provide an early warning system. With the affirmative results, this technique can serve beyond the detection of Denial of Service (DoS) and with sufficient development; an automated defensive solution can be achieved.},

	abstract = {We propose a novel approach for network-wide traffic state prediction where the statistical time series model ARIMA is used to postprocess the residuals out of the fundamental machine learning algorithm MLP. This approach is named as NN-ARIMA. Neural Network MLP is employed to capture network-scale co-movement pattern of all traffic flows, and ARIMA is used to further extract location-specific traffic features in the residual time series out of Neural Network. The experiment results show that the postprocessing the residuals of Neural Network by the ARIMA analysis helps to significantly improve accuracy of traffic state prediction by 8.9–13.4\% in term of mean squared error reduction. In order to verify the efficiency of the ARIMA analysis in the postprocessing, Multidimensional Support Vector Regression (MSVR) model is also employed to replace the role of Neural Network in the comparative experiment. Two streams of comparisons, (1) NN vs. NN-ARIMA and (2) MSVR vs. MSVR-ARIMA, are performed and show consistent results. The proposed approach not only can capture network-wide co-movement pattern of traffic flows, but also seize location-specific traffic characteristics as well as sharp nonlinearity of macroscopic traffic variables. The case study indicates that the accuracy of prediction can be significantly improved when both network-scale traffic features and location-specific characteristics are taken into account.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present and evaluate the outcomes of a measurement study amongst Android mobile device users, who volunteered their device-level network activity data through a newly developed mobile application in January 2013. We evaluate the submitted data in two hour time intervals with respect to device-level network traffic amounts, application network activity times, and data distribution (as measure of connectivity) between mobile (cellular) and wireless LAN networks. We find fairly homogeneous values with low levels of autocorrelation or long range dependence for the device-level amounts of data, but an indication for self-similarity for the summed application network usage times, which are positively correlated. In addition, we observe that the average distribution for cellular interface usage exhibits clear patterns for the day of the week as well as the time of the day. The combination of these findings can find direct utilization in future mobile device utilization modeling efforts.},

	abstract = {In the era of the digital world. The communication and the use the internet is an important role in today’s society. As a result, the number of users networks traffic increases but not enough resources for users causing users to receive inefficient services. Therefore, the network service provider must take action to fix the aforementioned problem. Forecasting is therefore necessary in order to determine the amount of network traffic in order to support the future increase in user numbers. Consequently, this research investigates to assess network traffic forecasts comparing the machine learning: Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and statistical methods: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Simple Moving Average (SMA). The method of sliding window will be used simultaneously and evaluate the forecast and model performance using the MAE, MAPE, MSE, RMSE and R-square algorithms, respectively. The results show that machine learning forecasting is more effective than statistical forecasting. Because the error value is lower, the model can reliably anticipate data. Therefore, the results of this research are expected to help network service provider to improve their networks quickly and efficiently to accommodate the number of users that may increase in the future.},

We propose the augmentation of fully convolutional networks with long short term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM RNN) sub-modules for time series classification. Our proposed models significantly enhance the performance of fully convolutional networks with a nominal increase in model size and require minimal preprocessing of the data set. The proposed long short term memory fully convolutional network (LSTM-FCN) achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared with others. We also explore the usage of attention mechanism to improve time series classification with the attention long short term memory fully convolutional network (ALSTM-FCN). The attention mechanism allows one to visualize the decision process of the LSTM cell. Furthermore, we propose refinement as a method to enhance the performance of trained models. An overall analysis of the performance of our model is provided and compared with other techniques.},

	abstract = {Data are naturally collected in their raw state and must undergo a series of preprocessing steps to obtain data in their input state for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and other applications. The data preprocessing phase is not only necessary to fit input requirements but also effective in improving AI training efficiency and output accuracy. Data preprocessing is a time consuming and complex phase that lacks a unified and structured approach. We survey data preprocessing techniques under different categories to provide an extended and structured scope of data preprocessing relevant to numerical time-series data. We also provide an empirical analysis of the impact of preprocessing techniques on the quality of the data and on the performance of AI algorithms. In addition, we discuss the feasibility of distributing some of the surveyed techniques to the edge. Leveraging edge computing to distribute data preprocessing reduces the workload on central systems, creates more manageable data lakes, reduces the consumption of resources (e.g., energy) and enables EdgeAI.},

	abstract = {Machine learning has been the corner stone in analysing and extracting information from data and often a problem of missing values is encountered. Missing values occur because of various factors like missing completely at random, missing at random or missing not at random. All these may result from system malfunction during data collection or human error during data pre-processing. Nevertheless, it is important to deal with missing values before analysing data since ignoring or omitting missing values may result in biased or misinformed analysis. In literature there have been several proposals for handling missing values. In this paper, we aggregate some of the literature on missing data particularly focusing on machine learning techniques. We also give insight on how the machine learning approaches work by highlighting the key features of missing values imputation techniques, how they perform, their limitations and the kind of data they are most suitable for. We propose and evaluate two methods, the k nearest neighbor and an iterative imputation method (missForest) based on the random forest algorithm. Evaluation is performed on the Iris and novel power plant fan data with induced missing values at missingness rate of 5\% to 20\%. We show that both missForest and the k nearest neighbor can successfully handle missing values and offer some possible future research direction.},
